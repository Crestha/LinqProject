# LinqProject
 Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is an innovation introduced in the .NET Framework version 3.5 that bridges the gap between the world of objects and the world of data.
 LINQ provides a set of standard query methods that you can use in a query. 
The standard query operators are the methods that form the LINQ pattern. Most of these methods operate on sequences, where a sequence is an object whose type implements the IEnumerable<T> interface or the IQueryable<T> interface. 
The standard query operators query functionality includes filtering, projection, aggregation, sorting, grouping, paging, and more. 
The simple example of the standard query operator methods that perform aggregation, concatenation, element, equality, filtering, generation, grouping, join, partitioning, projection, quantifier, set, sorting operations are presented in this LinqProject.
